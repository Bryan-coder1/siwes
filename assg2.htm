        ClearlyDefined is a crowdsourced project created by Microsoft in partnership with the Open Source Initiative. It was created in 2018 to boost the success of Open Source projects by more clearly defining project data. The project has seen a lot of growth since its inception, and thus we’d like to reintroduce ClearlyDefined to the OSI community.

        Not every project team working with Open Source is aware of the importance of meeting license obligations. For those that are aware, many don't know
how to attain the factual licensing data they need. such as an individual
project's licenses. source code location, and details to be included in
attributions, like copyrignt noiders. what ends up happening Is, users are <br> phone to: <br> </p>

    <li>waste time vetting open source software through repetitive,duplicative efforts,or</li>
  
  </ul>

<p style="margin-top: 8px; line-height: 26px;">
  Missing data means weaker engagement. Absence of important licensing information reduces participation in a project – that means fewer users, fewer contributors, and a smaller community.

Curation of that information is then facilitated through crowd-sourcing so it can be contributed to the upstream projects and included in the next release. Like any Open Source project, contributions are vetted and accepted by committers (called curators) before they are pushed up to the original projects.

        The ClearlyDefined community that collaborates and makes these contributions is comprised of individuals from organizations such as Microsoft, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., HERE Technologies, Amazon, nexB, the Eclipse Foundation, and Software Heritage. ClearlyDefined exists to contribute to a project’s success and build confidence for users.
